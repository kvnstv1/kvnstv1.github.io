I'm currently working through [phase 1] of Microsoft Student Accelerator 2024's Data Science Track. This includes topics like Python, AI on Azure, learning and classification models and power BI. My current progress is shown on my [Github] profile.

I am working on an image editing app with a team of classmates for a class project. I wrote a couple of key features like the median filter, vertical and hoprizontal image flipping and incorporated multilingual support. 

I am challenging myself to solve one Leetcode questions a day to sharpen my programming skills and to learn better algorithms to solve common problems. My progress is shown on my [leetcode] profile.

Finally, I am studying to take the Microsoft Azure [certification exam] using Microsoft Learn.

My current goal is to learn more about Data science and AI to become a more well-rounded candidate for summer internships.
