# About me
<br>
I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Otago. Apart from my coursework in data Structures and Algorithms, Information Systems and Software Engineering, I am also learning to program in python with an eye to studying machine learning. 

In the long run, I am interested in studying cellular automata and machine learning. 

I am a polyglot who has lived in 5 countries. I like reading literature from the 19th century and cooking Asian recipes. I also like trains.
